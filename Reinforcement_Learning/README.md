 Training and Evaluation

 Training the Q-Learning Agent

The Q-learning agent was trained over 50000 episodes. During training, the agent played games against itself, updating its Q-values based on the outcomes of these games. The training process involved:

- Exploration: The agent randomly explored the available actions with a 20% probability (as determined by the exploration rate, epsilon).

- Exploitation: The agent selected actions based on the highest Q-values with an 80% probability.

- Reward Calculation: Rewards were assigned based on the game outcome:
  - Player X win: +1.0
  - Player O win: -1.0
  - Tie: 0.5
  - Ongoing game: 0.0

 Evaluating the Q-Learning Agent

The trained Q-learning agent was evaluated through 50000 game sessions against a random player. The evaluation results are as follows:

- Wins: X wins (Player X):  46943
- Ties: 1093
-Defeats: 1964
- Win Percentage: 93.886%
- Tie Percentage: 2.186%
-Defeats Percentage: 3.928%
